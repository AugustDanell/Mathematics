# Mathematics
In this Git Hub repository I attempt to implement mathematical code pertaining to e.g Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods and Calculus. Linear Algebra in particular is, I think, surely a good thing to have some methods on whenever the need arises to do some operations on vectors and matrices. 

## Linear Algebra: 
Linear Algebra and Geometry is something that pertains to vectors, planes and more. 

## Numerical Methods:
There are many numerical methods such as simpson's rule to calculate integrals, central differance to calculate derivations etc. These methods are approximations of an analytical solutions, and so, I will try to implement some of that here and maybe I can make tests asserting that these methods come up with an answer that is close to the analytical calculus solution.  

## Calculus:

## Todo: Project
I have a project in mind which is to combine syntax analysis with Numerical Methods in writing a language that will take mathematical functions and then calculate the derivatives and integrals that are approximated using Numerical Methods such as Central Difference and Simpsons' rule. This is something I will try to implement.
